    <p>My name is Fahad Hai, and I am a full stack web developer. I was born in Karachi, Pakistan, and I'm currently a US citizen and a resident of the beautiful city of Houston, Texas. I have a Bachelors degree in Medicine from Pakistan, but after immigrating I decided to change career paths. I worked for 9 years as a administrative assistant and lead concierge at Northshore Skokie Hospital in Chicago before moving to Texas in 2019.</p>
    
    <p>I chose software and web development as my future career because along from being a 'techie' I have always wanted to create content rather than just consume. Rice University helped me realize my potential as a web developer and from there I was never turning back. As I dove deeper into the field of web development I found it to be extremely interesting, intellectually rewarding and satisfying. I found it to be the one field that I would actually welcome and await challenges as they were the rungs on my ladder to my professional development.</p>
