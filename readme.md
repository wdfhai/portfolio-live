## About The Project

A portfolio is like a digital handshake. The first time you interact with it, you can instantly infer certain qualities about the owner. The first impression may not be the last impression, but it is certainly the most important one. I started designing this portfolio after going through HTML/CSS for 10 hrs, and it has since evolved along with my knowledge of coding, and it will continue to do so throughout my career.

Some elements I considered highly for my portfolio were:

- a clean and modern UI,
- an intuitive design with well-implemented features,
- code that is as DRY as possible, which is easier said than done :smile:

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/)

## Getting Started

Check out the 'View Deployed Version' link above, or click <span><a href="https://wdfhai.github.io/portfolio-live/index.html" alt="link to deployed version"><em>here.</em></a></span>

## Usage

The portfolio can be viewed as version 2, which includes a new design and significant JavaScript/JQuery implementation, or version 1, based mostly on HTML5/CSS3 (other than a modal). Version 1 also has an all-in-one (or AIO) or a multi-page version.
