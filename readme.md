## About The Project

A portfolio is like a digital handshake. The first time you interact with it, you can instantly infer certain qualities about the owner. The first impression may not be the last impression, but it is certainly the most important one. I started designing this portfolio after going through HTML/CSS for 10 hrs, and it has since evolved along with my knowledge of coding, and it will continue to do so throughout my career.

Some elements I considered highly for my portfolio were:

- a clean and modern UI,
- an intuitive design with well-implemented features,
- code that is as DRY as possible, which is easier said than done :smile:

A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)

## Getting Started

Check out the 'View Demo' link above. Try both the single and multi-page versions.

## Usage

The portfolio can be viewed as an all-in-one (or AIO) or a multi-page version.
